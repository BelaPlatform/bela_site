<h1>Let Bela help you deliver</h1>

Taking the dive into the world of embedded computing, sensors, actuators and DSP can be intimidating, and the learning curve is steep. Bela comes with a library of over 100 well-documented examples, circuit diagrams and resources, to provide as many entry points as possible for students, educators and researchers from a huge range of disciplines.

Bela also offers support and consultancy services for educators, please get in touch as we would love to hear from you.

<h1>Why use Bela in your facility?</h1>

Bela is used to teach classes in universities, design schools and research institutions around the world. Students who use Bela in classes come from diverse subject areas, such as music technology, e-textiles, design, robotics, DSP, interaction design and more. Bela is ideal for both learners and teachers, as there are no complex tool-chains to install, no software packages to update. Plugging in and launching the IDE in a modern browser are all you need to start exploring the examples, programming the board, and running projects.

Bela has great resources for students learning about real-time processing. Our browser-based IDE not only makes getting started easy, but also includes anthe in-browser oscilloscope so students can visualise signals in real time, and instantly see the results of code changes. Along with C/C++, Bela also supports a range of languages to support a huge range of learning styles and methodologies, such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, FAUST, and Csound. This makes Bela flexible to use with differently-skilled groups of students and in a diversity of learning contexts.
