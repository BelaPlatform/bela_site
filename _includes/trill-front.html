      <h2>Trill Touch Sensors</h2>
      <p>Trill is a family of touch sensors that was inspired by the way musicians use their hands to interact with the world. Compatible with Bela as well as platforms like Arduino, Teensy and Raspberry Pi, Trill sensors use capacitive sensing to precisely track finger movements and positions. Trill sensors were funded on Kickstarter and are available now. Click below to find out more.</p>
