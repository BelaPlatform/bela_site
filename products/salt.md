SALT is a Bela-powered programmable synth module, and is a collaboration between Bela and <a href="https://www.rebeltech.org/">Rebel Technology</a>. SALT debuted at Superbooth 2018. The core SALT module has an embedded Bela unit, and features 4 CV I/O (with offset pots), stereo audio I/O, 2 trigger I/O, USB host port and 2 buttons with integrated bicolour LEDs.

Hungry for more inputs and outputs? Add the SALT+ expander, which offers 4 more CV I/O (with offset pots), 2 more trigger I/O, and 2 additional buttons with bicolour LEDs, as well as a USB device port to connect MIDI devices.

<h2>SALT: Adjust to taste</h2>

SALT was designed to be whatever you want it to be: an oscillator, a wave shaper, whatever you can imagine. Program it, re-program it, and make it into exactly what you need. It's your rack - season to taste.

SALT comes fully assembled, with an embedded Bela unit. Connect it to your laptop, navigate to the Bela IDE in a web browser, and start creating straight away. Program SALT using any of Bela's supported languages like C++, Pure Data, Supercollider, Csound. Start programming SALT from scratch, or open one of the SALT example patches that come pre-loaded in the Bela IDE.

<h2>Comes ready for experimentation</h2>

Because SALT is Bela-powered, just connect it to your computer, navigate to the Bela IDE in a web browser, and start creating SALT patches using C++, Pure Data, Supercollider, Csound, or any of Bela's supported languages. Start from scratch, or modify one of the example patches that comes with the Bela IDE.

<h2>Things to know:</h2>

Both SALT and SALT+ come fully assembled and ready to use, with installed painted aluminium faceplates.

SALT and SALT+ are sold separately. SALT is the core module with a built-in Bela unit. SALT+ is an expander for SALT, and can't be used on its own.

SALT is assembled to order. For this reason, please allow 2 weeks lead time.
