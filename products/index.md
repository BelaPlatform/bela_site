Welcome to our Bela Universe, home to Bela and Trill, as well as our Multichannel and Modular ranges.

Developed to provide ultra-low latency processing, high quality audio and both analog and digital I/O, the original Bela board started a wave of change for ambitious makers and creators the world over. 

Since this first spark, we have developed the Bela range to contain the popular and nimble Bela Mini. We have expanded our repertoire to sensors: seeing our Trill product range be considered as a gold standard of sensors, and, be compatible with multiple other digital maker products i.e. Arduino and many more. 

We have also expanded into more specialist hardware too, check out our Multichannel and Modular ranges to develop your creative appetite.
