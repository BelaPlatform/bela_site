Bela is hiring! We’re looking for an embedded software engineer for a 1-year full-time remote position, potentially renewable, to start as soon as possible. Join our dynamic, fully remote team to help us create the next generation of the Bela platform and support our growing user community!

## Job Description

Augmented Instruments Ltd, the London-based company behind Bela, is seeking to hire an Embedded Software Engineer to help us create the next generation of the Bela platform and to deliver bespoke products and services, with a particular focus on audio and music applications. We are looking for a creative and self-motivated engineer with experience in real-time audio programming and/or embedded systems. The ideal candidate will have interest in learning new skills and solving tricky technical problems, and will be comfortable working in a remote environment.

The position will start as soon as possible and will last for 1 year, with potential for extension subject to funding. A full-time position is strongly preferred, however depending on the candidate’s circumstances and experience we would consider a position of 3 or 4 days per week. Salary will be negotiated based on experience and full/part-time status.

The Bela codebase comprises C++ for the audio back-end, javascript/HTML5 for the web front-end, javascript/typescript (node.js) for the web back-end. It leverages a microcontroller and is built around an embedded Linux OS. The successful candidate will be expected to be able to contribute to one or more of these aspects of our development, according to the priorities outlined below:

### Skills and Experience:
- Proficiency in C or C++ programming (essential)
- Proficiency with real-time audio programming – e.g. with Bela, VST audio plugins, or another real-time environment (essential)
- Experience with embedded Linux or microcontroller firmware (strongly desirable)
- Knowledge of digital signal processing (optional but desirable)
- Knowledge of JavaScript programming and web development (optional but desirable)
- Experience with hardware design (optional but desirable)

The current Bela team consists of 5 members who collaborate remotely from London and continental Europe. The successful candidate can join us from any location, however availability during European working hours is preferred. UK-based candidates may be eligible for visitor access to Bela’s shared office and lab space at Queen Mary University of London (where Bela was originally founded), subject to agreement with the university.
