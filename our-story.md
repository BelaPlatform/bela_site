Bela is a project of the Augmented Instruments Laboratory, a research team in the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London.

Bela was created in 2014, when we were building a new musical instrument called the D-Box, a research project funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. 

It has been a great journey, powered by our pursuit for ultra-low latency and a desire to make interactions with hardware more human.
